# MONILE: MOdeling, miNIng and LEarning on temporal networks

MONILE is a tutorial on the research field of "Temporal Networks" from different viewpoints:
- Modeling and representing temporal networks
- Mining temporal networks and dynamic graphs
- Machine learning on temporal networks

Currently, the first edition of this tutorial is hosted at the 4th Italian Conference on Big Data and Data Science - [ITADATA2025](https://www.itadata.it/)
